==========================

This repo contains the code for Temporal Normalizing Flows. We also included an example notebook.

It's easiest to run the code using the docker container. Simply run the 'start_notebook.sh' script in the config folder (from the config folder as well) and it will download the correct docker image, check if you have a GPU installed, run it and install the code.
